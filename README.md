# README

The source for the presentation is `boxen-slides.adoc`, which is using [Asciidoctor + deck.js integration](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/install-and-use-deckjs-backend/).

To generate the presentation, which will then be created in `boxen-slides.html`, simply run
```shell
./slides generate
```

The only precondition is having [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) installed, as everything else will be automatically resolved.
